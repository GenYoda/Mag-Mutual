It's possible for the Standard of Care to be of high quality and the Causation to be very good, and yet the Degree of Injury could be severe, including major permanent harm or even death. Conversely, even when the Standard of Care and Causation are significantly lacking, the Degree of Injury might be minimal. This distinction highlights that the severity of an injury does not directly correlate with the quality of care or show a causal relationship. The SOC is the care, skill, and treatment recognized as pertinent by similar, reasonably prudent health care providers. It is determined in the context of all relevant circumstances and available information. SOC serves as the benchmark in assessing the appropriateness of the provider's actions, including both direct patient care and in the supervision of or formal collaboration with other providers. Conceptually, the standard of care is a continuum, ranging from that which is minimally required to that which is exceptional. Accordingly, to meet the standard, a provider's care, at the very least, must be considered acceptable; otherwise, it is negligent care. The standard in any given situation is influenced by several factors, including but not limited to statutes, regulations, clinical guidelines, research, and facility policies and procedures. Based on your thorough assessment, provide a final rating of the standard of care. 1. SELECT ONE",

Therefore, the physician has not met the SOC for missing the diagnosis of CVA, but the defendant's actions did not cause or contribute to the injury because thrombolytics and thrombectomy are no longer indicated by the time the patient presents.

Imaging and evaluations confirmed an acute ischemic stroke due to ischemia and a hypertensive emergency. While thrombolytics (TNK) and IV nicardipine were started at an outside facility, there is no indication that delays in care at Memorial Health significantly altered the patient's outcome, as the stroke had already occurred prior to arrival.
