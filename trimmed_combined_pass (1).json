The document outlines the symptoms of CA-UTIs, which may include burning or pain in the lower abdomen, fever, bloody urine, burning during urination, or increased frequency of urination after catheter removal. It also notes that some individuals may not exhibit these symptoms. The document emphasizes that CA-UTIs are treatable with antibiotics and removal or replacement of the catheter, with the choice of antibiotic determined by the healthcare provider. Preventative measures are described, including proper hand hygiene by healthcare providers, sterile catheter insertion techniques, cleaning the skin before insertion, securing the catheter to prevent pulling, avoiding twisting or kinking of the tubing, and keeping the urine bag below the bladder level to prevent backflow. Patients are advised to clean their hands before and after catheter care, avoid tugging or pulling on the tubing, and inquire daily about the necessity of the catheter. The document also provides guidance for patients going home with a catheter, stressing the importance of understanding catheter care and knowing whom to contact in case of questions or problems. It advises patients to seek medical attention if symptoms of a urinary tract infection develop.

      "description_full": "The patient underwent an MRI BATT at approximately 01:00 as part of the initial stroke workup, which had been delayed due to the patient's clinical status. The imaging revealed an evolving large right MCA territory subacute infarction with scattered regions of petechial staining and hemosiderin deposition. There was a resultant 1.2 cm leftward midline shift, which was a significant increase compared to the 5 mm shift noted on the CT scan from February 24, 2020. Additionally, a punctate cortical infarct was identified in the left frontal lobe posteriorly. No abnormal brain parenchymal signal intensity, significant volume loss, mass, or extra-axial fluid collection was observed. Mass effect and effacement of the right lateral ventricle were noted. Despite these findings, there was no documentation of a change in the patient's mental status or any adjustment to the treatment plan based on the imaging results. The attending radiologist reviewed all images, agreed with the interpretation, and provided appropriate supervision for the exam.",

Risk factors are categorized into modifiable (e.g., smoking, birth control use, physical inactivity) and non-modifiable (e.g., age over 60, prior stroke or TIA, family history). Symptoms of stroke are described as sudden onset weakness or loss of sensation in the face, arm, or leg (often unilateral), loss of balance, slurred speech, difficulty understanding speech, visual disturbances, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and severe headache. The document emphasizes the importance of noting the exact time of symptom onset and seeking immediate medical attention, as treatments are most effective within 3-6 hours of symptom onset. Treatment options include clot-dissolving medications, blood pressure control, blood thinners, oxygen therapy, IV fluids, and procedures to restore blood flow. Post-stroke rehabilitation with therapists is also mentioned. Home care instructions include taking medications as prescribed, dietary modifications, safety measures to prevent falls, and avoiding smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. Preventative measures for reducing stroke risk include managing high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, and sleep problems, as well as maintaining a healthy weight, diet, and exercise routine. The document also outlines the 'BE FAST' mnemonic for recognizing stroke symptoms: Balance issues, Eye changes, Facial droop, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties, and Time to call emergency services. The document concludes with general lifestyle recommendations from the American Heart Association, including the DASH and Mediterranean diets and regular exercise. The document was revised and reviewed on 07/28/2021.",

The result was authorized by Dr. Igor Aksenov and processed by Memorial Health Laboratory, Savannah, GA. The Hemoglobin A1C level was reported as 10.3%, significantly above the reference range of 4.0-5.6%. The narrative accompanying the result explained that values between 5.7-6.4% indicate an increased risk for developing diabetes mellitus, while values greater than or equal to 6.5% are diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. For individuals without unequivocal hyperglycemia, repeat testing is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. The specimen used for testing was whole blood. This result strongly suggests that the claimant has diabetes mellitus, requiring further clinical management and monitoring.",

      "description_full": "The patient, Frank Ward, underwent an upper GI endoscopy and PEG tube placement on 02/17/2023 at Memorial Health. The procedure was indicated due to dysphagia. Prior to sedation, red rules procedures and time-out policies were followed. The patient was adequately sedated and placed in the supine position with a protective bite block between the teeth. The endoscope was advanced through the upper esophageal sphincter into the stomach without difficulty. The stomach was fully visualized, retroflexed to examine the gastroesophageal junction, and the pylorus was identified. The endoscope was passed into the duodenum, visualizing the first and second portions. The anterior abdominal wall was palpated and transillumination was used to select the best site for PEG tube placement. The area was prepared and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine was administered. A 1 cm incision was made, and the stomach was accessed percutaneously under direct visualization. A catheter was placed, and the PEG tube was fastened to the pull wire, drawn through the esophagus, and brought through the abdominal wall. The tube was secured at 5 cm depth, cut to length, and connected to gravity drainage. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no complications noted. The attending physician was present throughout the critical portions of the procedure. Post-procedure, the patient was stable in the PACU, with the PEG tube set to gravity drainage for 24 hours and cleared for medication administration.",

      "description_full": "The patient, a 53-year-old male, collapsed at a gas station at approximately 06:15. This was identified as the last known well time. Upon presentation, the patient exhibited left arm and leg weakness, slurred speech, and left-sided facial droop. The patient was noted to have a history of diabetes. Initial vitals included blood pressure of 206/110 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 bpm, and point-of-care glucose of 253 mg/dL. The patient weighed 136 kg. NIH Stroke Scale was completed, scoring 10, with findings of partial paralysis of the lower face, no effort against gravity in the left arm, no movement in the left leg, mild-to-moderate sensory loss, and no aphasia or dysarthria. CT imaging was ordered at 06:59 and completed shortly thereafter, showing no acute findings. CTA revealed severe right M1 segment stenosis/occlusion, and CTP demonstrated a penumbra volume of 212 mL with no core infarct. The patient was deemed a good candidate for tPA administration once blood pressure was reduced below 185/110 mmHg. Mechanical thrombectomy was also indicated, and transfer to a local MT center was recommended. Recommendations included stroke education, avoidance of Foley catheter, and use of pneumatic compression devices. Diagnostic workup included MRI head, MRA head, and transthoracic echocardiogram.",

Vitals included blood pressure of 206/110 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 bpm, and point-of-care glucose of 253 mg/dL. NIH Stroke Scale was initiated, scoring 10, with findings of partial paralysis of the lower face, no effort against gravity in the left arm, no movement in the left leg, mild-to-moderate sensory loss, and no aphasia or dysarthria. CT imaging was ordered at 06:59 and completed shortly thereafter, showing no acute findings. CTA revealed severe right M1 segment stenosis/occlusion, and CTP demonstrated a penumbra volume of 212 mL with no core infarct. The patient was deemed a good candidate for tPA administration once blood pressure was reduced below 185/110 mmHg. Mechanical thrombectomy was also indicated, and transfer to a local MT center was recommended.",

The claimant was noted to have a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with evolution. The clinical documentation indicates the claimant had undergone a craniectomy and was using a helmet when up. The claimant also had a capped tracheostomy and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. The claimant was described as having dense left hemiparesis with upper extremity subluxation. The documentation does not provide specific details regarding the claimant’s initial presentation, vital signs, or neurological examination findings at the time of admission. However, the presence of significant neurological deficits and the need for advanced airway and nutritional support suggest a severe and evolving stroke. The claimant’s care plan included ongoing monitoring in the Neuro ICU, with precautions and equipment tailored to their condition.

Neutrophils were elevated at 86.7% (reference range: 40.0-70.0%), while lymphocytes were decreased at 5.6% (reference range: 15.0-45.0%), consistent with a possible bacterial infection.

The anion gap was reduced at 6 (reference range: 10-20), and phosphorus was slightly low at 2.48 mg/dL (reference range: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL).

EMS responded to the scene where the patient was found in a semi-fowler's position on the bed, displaying left-sided facial droop and left-sided weakness. The patient was alert and oriented (GCS 15) with stable vitals: blood pressure 146/90, pulse 96, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation 98%. The patient was on a Cardene drip for elevated blood pressure, and an 18-gauge IV was established in the right antecubital vein by St. Joe. TNK (Tenecteplase) was administered at 07:52 AM. The patient was transferred to a stretcher using a draw sheet method and attached to a cardiac monitor, which showed sinus rhythm without ectopic beats. During transport, the patient was continuously monitored, and no changes in condition were noted. Upon arrival at Memorial Health University Medical Center, the patient underwent a stroke assessment, which caused a delay. The patient was then transferred to the neuro ICU (B-15) and care was handed over to the nurse on duty. The EMS team documented the patient's medical history, including primary hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and noted no recent travel or exposure to illness. The report provides detailed information about the patient's prehospital care and transport, including the administration of TNK and the patient's stable condition throughout.",

Precautions included fall risk, supplemental oxygen, and monitoring for right MCA CVA evolution post-TNK and thrombectomy on 2/17. Pain assessment revealed no reports of pain. Objective evaluation showed the patient was alert, oriented to person, place, and situation, but required cues to redirect attention and initiate tasks. Safety judgment and awareness of errors were decreased. Perception findings included neglect of the left side of the body and visual field, requiring verbal cues to maintain midline. Bed mobility required maximum assistance from two individuals, and sitting balance training was conducted at the edge of the bed for approximately 10 minutes before fatigue set in. The patient demonstrated a left lean with decreased midline awareness and head control, with a right gaze preference. Improvement was noted in attending to the left side of the environment, though neglect persisted despite maximum verbal cues.

General precautions included fall risk and right MCA CVA with evolution, status post TNK and thrombectomy, and dobhoff tube placement. The patient reported no pain. Cognitive evaluation revealed exceptions to within functional limits, with the patient alert and responsive but requiring repetition and increased time to follow one-step commands. Awareness of errors was decreased. Perceptual assessment showed inattention and neglect, requiring cues to maintain midline in sitting, attend to the left side of the body, and attend to the left visual field. The Modified Rankin Score was documented as 5. Bed mobility required maximum assistance of two with the head of the bed raised and bed rail towards the right side. Sitting balance was assessed, with the patient sitting at the edge of the bed for 10 minutes before becoming fatigued. Emphasis was placed on upright tolerance, postural control, and midline awareness. Improved head control was noted, aided by a soft travel neck pillow with towel rolls on the right side, brought in by the patient's wife. Maximum assistance was required for balance, with maximum verbal cueing to maintain head and trunk in neutral. Input was provided to bilateral scapulae to assist with postural control. During ADLs, the patient performed self-feeding while seated at the edge of the bed with speech therapy present. The patient was able to grasp a spoon and cup with the right upper extremity with standby assistance, requiring increased time to reach across midline to the left side of the environment. Visual tracking across midline to the left side was noted. Left shoulder subluxation was observed and elevated on two pillows at the end of treatment. The patient required maximum assistance to reach across midline with the right upper extremity to grasp and manipulate the left upper extremity. The patient was left in bed with the call light and essentials within reach, and the bed alarm was activated. The assessment indicated the patient was progressing as expected, with a recommendation to continue per the occupational therapy plan of care.

The patient is currently NPO with Dobhoff tube feeds but was cleared for puree and mildly thick liquids for comfort the previous day. The patient's wife was present during the session. No pain was indicated. During the objective evaluation, the patient was given mildly thick liquids via straw and self-fed, with oral and pharyngeal function noted to be within functional limits. Puree was presented via spoon and self-fed, with oral function within functional limits but spillage noted on the left side. Pharyngeal function was within functional limits. Cognitively, the patient demonstrated exceptions to within functional limits, with mild impairment in thought organization and a need for cues to redirect attention. The patient followed most one-step commands without difficulty but with occasional delays. Functional communication was noted to be adequate for simple conversation and expressing wants/needs. Cervical rotation exercises to the left were completed with maximum cueing required. Oral motor exercises were completed, though the patient continued to show limited range of motion and strength. The patient demonstrated improved head control and positioning while sitting edge of bed, with continued improvement in self-correction. PO trials of pudding and mildly thick liquids were presented, with no overt signs or symptoms of aspiration observed. The patient showed improving cognition and awareness, allowing for the completion of compensatory strategies and oral motor exercises. Recommendations included continuing NPO status with Dobhoff tube feeds, allowing snacks of pudding and mildly thick liquids or carbonated drinks without thickener for comfort, and maintaining upright positioning during oral intake. Dysphagia treatment and cognitive therapy were recommended, with a plan to continue speech therapy during hospitalization. The patient was assessed to have a moderate aspiration risk, and compensatory swallowing strategies were recommended, including small bites/sips, slow eating/feeding, and one-to-one assistance with meals. Medications were recommended to be administered via feeding tube.",

Comparison was made to multiple prior imaging studies, with the most recent being a CT head on February 24, 2023. Findings included an evolving large right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory subacute infarction with scattered regions of petechial staining and a resultant 1.2 cm leftward midline shift. Additionally, a punctate cortical infarct was noted in the left posterior frontal lobe. There was no abnormal brain parenchymal signal intensity, no significant volume loss, no mass or mass effect, and no extra-axial fluid collection. However, there was mass effect and effacement of the right lateral ventricle. The impression confirmed the evolving large right MCA territory subacute infarction with regions of hemosiderin deposition/petechial staining and the 1.2 cm leftward midline shift, as well as the additional punctate cortical infarct in the left posterior frontal lobe. The attending radiologist, Dr. Andreas Schilling, reviewed all images, agreed with the interpretation, and provided appropriate supervision for the exam.

      "notes": "At 09:36, Thomas Allen, PA, noted Mr. Ward was less alert compared to the previous week. Mr. Ward was resting but aroused with prompting and had no verbal response that morning. Due to the mental status change, a full review of systems was not performed. PA Allen referenced the MRI from 2/26/2023, which showed a 1.2 cm midline shift. He planned to review the results of the repeat CT head scheduled for that morning and indicated that if the shift exceeded 1.0 cm, Mr. Ward might require transfer to a monitored unit and hypertonic saline therapy.",
      "description_full": "Thomas Allen, PA, with the neurosurgical team, noted that Mr. Ward was 'somewhat less alert this morning versus last week.' He documented that Mr. Ward was 'resting but arouses with prompting' and had 'no verbal response this morning.' Due to the mental status change, he was unable to perform a full review of systems. PA Allen referenced the brain MRI from 2/26/2023, which suggested an increasing midline shift up to 1.2 cm. His plan included awaiting the results of a repeat CT head without contrast scheduled for that morning. He noted that if the shift was still increased past 1.0 cm, Mr. Ward would likely need to be transferred back to a monitored unit and resume hypertonic saline therapy. He planned to review the CT images once available and base final recommendations on the findings.",

      "description_full": "The patient, a 53-year-old male with a history of a large right MCA distribution infarction and associated mass effect with midline shift, underwent a right frontal temporal parietal decompressive hemi craniectomy and placement of a subdural ICP monitor. Preoperatively, the patient had left hemiparesis and left-sided neglect. He was initially treated medically with 3% normal saline and blood pressure management, followed by aspirin and Lovenox. Despite initial improvement, the patient developed increasing sleepiness and imaging (CT and MRI) revealed worsening midline shift. Due to neurological decline, emergent surgery was recommended. The patient and/or their representative were informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives, including risks of death, neurological injury, bleeding, infection, and failure of symptom resolution. Consent was obtained. \n\nDuring the procedure, the patient was placed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. A PICC line and arterial line were placed. Perioperative IV antibiotics (Rocephin) were administered, along with IV Lasix, 12 mg of Decadron, and a bolus of 250 cc of 3% normal saline, followed by a maintenance drip at 30 cc/hour. Sodium levels were monitored and maintained between 150-155. The patient was positioned in a Mayfield head holder, and a reversed question mark incision was made. Hemostasis was achieved using Raney clips, and a craniotome was used to create a bone flap, which was treated with antibiotics. The dura was opened in a horseshoe fashion, and the brain was noted to be full. Additional temporal bone was removed to allow for decompression. The middle meningeal artery was cauterized, and the subdural space was irrigated with antibiotic-laden saline until clear. FloSeal was applied for hemostasis. A subdural ICP monitor was placed through a separate stab incision and secured. The dura was covered with DuraGen, and the wound was closed with interrupted sutures and running nylon. Bacitracin ointment and a sterile dressing were applied. \n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure without apparent complications. Needle, sponge, and instrument counts were correct. The patient was kept intubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable but critical condition.",

Assessment noted significant disability (Modified Rankin Score 5), fall risk, and generalized weakness. Recommendations included continued physical therapy post-acute discharge, emphasizing gait training, strengthening, and neuro re-education. The session lasted 26 minutes.",
      "description_full": "The patient, Frank Ward, was supine in bed and cleared for therapy by the registered nurse. The patient required a linen change due to an ice pack leak. Precautions included fall risk, right middle cerebral artery (MCA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with evolution, status post TNK administration and thrombectomy, increased midline shift with left craniectomy, right wrist restraint, helmet, and 35% tracheostomy to ventilator. The patient was unable to report pain but was repositioned for comfort after treatment. Cognitive evaluation revealed the patient was sleepy but arousable and had exceptions to within functional limits (WFL) in direction following. During therapy, the patient was log-rolled left and right multiple times with maximum to total assistance from two individuals for hygiene and linen change. He was kept in a side-lying position for an extended time for hygiene and linen change before being returned to supine and scooted up in bed with total assistance from two individuals. Passive range of motion (PROM) was performed on both lower extremities to maintain range of motion and joint integrity and facilitate future mobility. The patient was left in bed with the call light and essentials within reach, the bed alarm activated, and all lines and tubes in place. The assessment noted a decline in ambulation, decreased lower extremity strength, decreased safe judgment, decreased activity tolerance, gait instability, fall risk, decreased balance, decreased functional ability, decreased high-level ADLs, generalized weakness, impaired gait, and impaired transfers. The Modified Rankin Score was 5, indicating significant disability. The prognosis was good for stated goals, and the patient remained in ICU/critical care. Recommendations included continued physical therapy post-acute discharge, focusing on gait training, endurance, transfer training, bed mobility, therapeutic exercise, therapeutic activity, strengthening, balance, neuro re-education, patient and family education, equipment evaluation and education, stair training, range of motion, and wheelchair mobility 3-5 times per week. The session lasted 26 minutes, from 11:00 to 11:26.",

PROM was performed on both lower extremities to maintain joint integrity and facilitate future mobility, with active-assisted range of motion (AAROM) performed on the right lower extremity for 10 repetitions in all planes to the patient's tolerance. Range of motion was within functional limits (WFL), but increased pain was noted in the left lower extremity during left hip range of motion. The patient was left in bed with needs within reach, all lines and tubes secured, and the right wrist restraint in place. The trach to vent remained intact. The assessment noted decreased functional ability, balance, and lower extremity strength, along with impaired transfers, generalized weakness, and a decline in ambulation. The patient was identified as requiring 24/7 care due to trach to vent and right-sided weakness. The plan included interventions such as gait training, endurance exercises, transfer training, bed mobility, therapeutic exercises, strengthening, balance training, neuro re-education, patient and family education, equipment evaluation, stair training, range of motion exercises, and wheelchair mobility. Discharge recommendations included continued post-acute therapy and transfer to a long-term acute care facility (LTAC). The evaluation time was calculated as 13 minutes, from 08:42 to 08:55.",

The patient was sedated and placed in the supine position. A protective bite block was placed, and an endoscope was advanced through the upper esophageal sphincter into the stomach under direct visualization. The stomach and gastroesophageal junction were fully visualized, and the pylorus was identified. The endoscope was advanced into the duodenum, where the first and second portions were visualized. The anterior abdominal wall was palpated, and the area of best impulse and transillumination was selected. The area was marked, prepared, and draped in a sterile fashion. Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine was administered. A 1 cm incision was made, and the stomach was accessed percutaneously with a needle/catheter under direct visualization. The catheter was grasped with a snare, and the pull wire was placed through the catheter into the stomach. The wire was then grasped and withdrawn carefully. The PEG tube was fastened to the pull wire, drawn down the esophagus into the stomach, and brought through the abdominal wall with gentle traction. The procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was minimal. Findings included a normal upper GI endoscopy. The procedure was documented as successful, and the patient tolerated it well.",

Passive range of motion (PROM) was performed on the left upper extremity (LUE) in all joints and planes, with limited shoulder flexion due to glenohumeral (GH) joint subluxation. The patient was left in bed with all needs within reach. The assessment indicated that the patient would continue to benefit from skilled occupational therapy services to promote safety and independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) and functional mobility. Discharge recommendations included continued post-acute therapy and transfer to a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility. The treatment time was documented as 9 minutes. Goals and the treatment plan were discussed and agreed upon with the patient.",

Cognitively, the patient was alert and responsive but required cues to attend to the left side of the body, left visual field, and to maintain midline in sitting. Bed mobility was dependent, requiring two-person assistance for supine to sit, sit to supine, and scooting up to the head of the bed using a draw sheet. The patient demonstrated significant fear of falling and very poor spatial awareness. Static and dynamic sitting balance required maximum assistance from two people, with no self-righting reactions and increased fear of falling. The patient required increased cues for attention to the left side and was only able to briefly turn head and eyes to midline or towards the left once before returning to a supine position. The session highlighted the patient’s ongoing need for intensive physical therapy to address significant deficits in mobility, balance, and spatial awareness.",

A #6 cuffless Shiley tracheostomy tube was in place, and the claimant was on a trach collar. The claimant remains NPO except for ice chips and small teaspoons of puree sparingly for comfort only. During the session, the speech-language pathologist (SLP) placed a speaking valve, which resulted in positive voicing, though vocal quality was mildly weak. Minimal verbal responses to questions were noted, likely impacted by lethargy. Trials of ice chips, mildly thick liquid, and pureed consistencies were presented. The claimant demonstrated slow mastication of ice and delayed/immediate throat clearing with mildly thick liquid and pureed consistencies. No overt signs or symptoms of aspiration were observed during the trials, and the claimant maintained stable vitals throughout the session. Recommendations included continuing SLP therapy, maintaining strict aspiration precautions, and using the PEG tube as the primary source of nutrition and medication. The claimant's wife was educated on how to place and remove the speaking valve. The SLP will continue to monitor for PO tolerance and readiness for diet initiation as appropriate during the hospital stay.",

      "notes": "At 15:01, the claimant underwent physical therapy evaluation and treatment. Precautions included fall risk, supplemental oxygen, and helmet use due to MCA CVA with evolution and left craniotomy. Bed mobility required two-person assistance, and safety judgment was impaired with decreased awareness of the need for assistance. The claimant demonstrated inattention and neglect, requiring cues for left-side awareness. Recommendations included continuing physical therapy and intensive rehabilitation upon disposition.",
      "description_full": "The claimant was agreeable to physical therapy and denied any pain during the session. Precautions included skin care, fall risk, supplemental oxygen, and specific precautions related to MCA CVA with evolution, s/p TNK and thrombectomy, increased midline shift with left craniotomy, helmet use when upright, trach collar, PEG tube, new dialysis, and MRSA. Objective evaluation revealed decreased insight and delayed direction following, with the claimant able to follow one-step commands with increased time and repetition. Safety judgment was impaired, with decreased awareness of the need for assistance. Perception issues included inattention and neglect, requiring cues to attend to the left side of the body, left visual field, and midline in sitting, as well as cues to initiate tasks. Communication was noted as occasional verbalizations. Bed mobility from supine to sitting required two-person assistance, with dependent trunk and bilateral lower extremity assistance. Assistance was also required for proper positioning of extremities on the floor and bed. The claimant's active problem list included CVA, hypertensive emergency, diabetes mellitus type 2 in obesity, s/p craniotomy, presence of IVC filter, acute respiratory failure with hypoxia, structural encephalopathy, dysphagia, staphylococcal pneumonia, pneumonia of the right lower lobe due to Pseudomonas species, acute kidney injury, and persistent proteinuria. The assessment indicated ongoing physical therapy services were recommended, with the claimant requiring intensive rehabilitation upon disposition.",

Precautions included MCA CVA with evolution, s/p TNK and thrombectomy, increased midline shift with left craniectomy, helmet when up, trach collar, and PEG tube. The patient showed no appearance of pain during the session. The patient was supine in bed, and the RN reported that the patient had received medication earlier in the morning, causing increased drowsiness. Due to this drowsiness, sitting edge-of-bed transfer and seated balance exercises were deferred. The patient tolerated bilateral lower extremity passive range of motion (PROM) with total assistance to improve tissue extensibility, joint mobility, and prevent contractures. The left lower extremity was positioned into neutral hip alignment, and the patient's wife was educated on preventing frequent hip external rotation and abduction. The ankle was positioned to facilitate dorsiflexion to prevent prolonged plantar flexion and increased tightness in the ankle and Achilles tendon. Decreased active movement in the right lower extremity was noted, likely due to drowsiness from medication. The patient was scooted to the head of the bed in supine and repositioned into a chair position to improve physiological function and increase upright activity tolerance. The patient remains in ICU/critical care with a Modified Rankin Score of 5. The prognosis was noted as good with continued physical therapy post-acute discharge.

Sitting balance was poor, with a strong left lean and pushing with the right upper extremity. The patient required maximum assistance for upper body dressing and was unable to engage in ADLs due to impaired balance and cognition. The Modified Rankin Score was 5. The plan included continued therapy with interventions such as balance training, ADL training, and neuromuscular re-education. Equipment recommendations included a Hoyer lift, hospital bed, and specialty wheelchair.",
      "description_full": "The patient was seen for occupational therapy. Subjectively, the patient expressed concern, stating, 'Please don't break my back.' The patient reported back pain while seated at the edge of the bed (EOB). Precautions included right MCA CVA with evolution, left craniectomy with helmet when up, trach collar, and PEG tube. Cognitively, the patient was alert and responsive but demonstrated difficulty attending to directions, following one-step commands with repetition and increased time, and had decreased safety judgment and awareness of errors. The patient required cues to maintain midline in sitting and to attend to the left visual field. The patient perseverated on concerns about their back 'breaking' and exhibited a right gaze preference, making redirection difficult. Objectively, the patient required maximum assistance to raise their head from the bed surface to don a helmet and total assistance from two persons for supine-to-sit transitions with the head of the bed raised and bed rail support. Sitting balance was poor, requiring total assistance to maintain balance at the EOB. The patient exhibited a strong left lean and pushing with the right upper extremity, making it difficult to achieve midline. The patient was physically placed in right forearm weight-bearing to prevent heavy left lean and loss of balance. The patient was unable to engage in ADLs while seated at the EOB due to impaired sitting balance and cognition. Upper body dressing required maximum assistance in a semi-Fowler's position. The patient was left in bed with the call light and essentials within reach, and the bed alarm was activated. The assessment noted that the patient was progressing as expected and recommended continuing the occupational therapy plan of care. The treatment plan included interventions such as balance training, ADL/IADL training, functional mobility and transfers, therapeutic activity, therapeutic exercise, ROM, patient and family education, energy conservation, neuromuscular re-education, sensation, cognition, vision/perception, fine motor coordination, and upper extremity edema management. Discharge recommendations included continued post-acute therapy and equipment recommendations for a Hoyer lift, hospital bed, and specialty wheelchair.",

Sagittal and coronal reformats were obtained. Findings included stable postsurgical changes of a right frontoparietotemporal craniectomy, a large region of encephalomalacia and gliosis within the right MCA territory, and mildly decreased transcranial herniation of brain parenchyma. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, no new regions of gray-white matter differentiation loss, no hydrocephalus, and no midline shift were noted. Stable ex vacuo dilation of the right lateral ventricle secondary to prior MCA infarction was observed. The density of the dural venous sinuses was normal. No new calvarial or skull base abnormality was identified. Additional findings included a right maxillary sinus mucocele versus retention cyst and chronic opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally. The visualized orbits were unremarkable. Impression: No acute intracranial process. Large region of right MCA territory encephalomalacia with mildly decreased transcranial herniation of brain parenchyma.

The patient agreed to treatment and was noted to have precautions due to a recent bone flap replacement during this hospital stay, a history of CVA with hemorrhagic conversion, and left-sided deficits. The patient complained of left hip pain during range of motion exercises and was repositioned for comfort. Upon entering the room, the patient was supine in bed. Supine-to-sit transitions required maximum assistance, and the patient sat on the edge of the bed with moderate assistance and maximum cues to reduce pushing to the left side and leaning to the left. Right upper extremity extension was facilitated to improve upright posture during sitting. The patient withdrew from pain in the left lower extremity during dynamic reaching exercises aimed at improving trunk control and sitting balance. Cervical stretching was performed to address right-sided tightness, as the patient favored right lateral flexion. Sit-to-supine transitions required maximum assistance. The patient was positioned on the left side for pressure relief and right cervical stretching, with cues provided for midline awareness. The patient was left in bed with needs within reach, the bed alarm activated, and lines in place. The assessment noted decreased functional ability, balance, activity tolerance, and lower extremity strength, as well as impaired transfers, decreased safe judgment, and a decline in ambulation. The patient was identified as having generalized weakness and a high fall risk, requiring 24/7 assistance. The treatment plan included gait training, transfer training, bed mobility, therapeutic exercise, therapeutic activity, strengthening, balance training, neuro re-education, equipment evaluation and education, range of motion exercises, wheelchair mobility, endurance training, patient and family education, and stair training. Discharge recommendations included post-acute therapy to maximize functional status, requiring comprehensive therapy in two or more disciplines for at least three hours per day, five days per week. The evaluation time was calculated as 23 minutes, from 10:12 to 10:35. The note was electronically signed by Kendra Smith, PT, at 13:35.",

      "description_full": "The patient, Frank Ward, was evaluated by Kara Scott, OT, on June 26, 2023, at 16:00. The patient presented with an active problem list including CVA, hypertensive emergency, type 2 diabetes mellitus in obesity, status post craniotomy, acute respiratory failure with hypoxia, structural encephalopathy, dysphagia, staphylococcal pneumonia, pneumonia of the right lower lobe due to Pseudomonas species, acute kidney injury, persistent proteinuria, acute blood loss anemia, acute ischemic right MCA stroke, cardiac arrest, and acquired skull defect. The patient was four days post-op from a cranioplasty with autologous bone flap replacement. Precautions included fall risk and considerations related to the bone flap replacement and history of CVA with hemorrhagic conversion and left-sided deficits. The patient was received in bed and agreeable to therapy, though they made slowed responses and required increased time to engage with the therapist. The patient complained of pain with lower extremity and hip movement. During the evaluation, the patient demonstrated a Modified Rankin Score of 4. Supine scooting to the head of the bed for improved positioning required total assistance. Supine-to-sit transitions to the left side of the bed required maximum assistance, though the patient was able to initiate upper body movement and assist with the right side. Therapy focused on sitting balance, upright tolerance, body awareness, and spatial positioning. The patient required moderate to minimal assistance for sitting balance at the edge of the bed, with cues to avoid pushing with the right upper extremity. The right upper extremity was extended on the bed rail for support and to reduce pushing, while weight-bearing through the left upper extremity was encouraged to increase sensory input and facilitate neuro re-education.

The imaging was performed using unenhanced axial images obtained from the skull base to the vertex. Dose-optimizing techniques were utilized, including automated exposure control, adjustment of mA and/or kV according to patient size, and/or use of iterative reconstruction technique. Comparison was made to a prior head CT without contrast dated 2023-05-22. Findings included no mass effect or midline shift, with mild ex vacuo dilatation of portions of the right lateral ventricle. Hypodensity was noted throughout the right MCA territory, consistent with a maturing infarct. Postoperative fluid and air were observed underlying the craniotomy, measuring up to 1.6 cm on coronal images. Scattered air foci were present within the left ventricle. Additionally, soft tissue swelling, fluid, and air foci were noted along the right convexity scalp. Opacification of the right mastoid air cells and right middle ear was also documented. The impression included expected changes related to a recent autologous right hemispheric cranioplasty with postoperative fluid underlying the craniotomy, soft tissue swelling, and fluid overlying the right convexity. Follow-up examination was recommended to document resolution of the right convexity fluid. The findings were consistent with a maturing right MCA territory infarct.

Axial images were obtained from the skull base to the vertex using dose-optimizing techniques such as automated exposure control, adjustment of mA and/or kV according to patient size, and iterative reconstruction technique. Comparison was made to a prior head CT dated May 22, 2023. Findings included hypodensity throughout the right MCA territory consistent with a maturing infarct. Mild ex vacuo dilatation of portions of the right lateral ventricle was noted without mass effect or midline shift. Postoperative fluid and air underlying the craniotomy measured up to 1.6 cm on coronal images, with scattered air foci within the left ventricle. Soft tissue swelling, fluid, and air foci were observed along the right convexity scalp, along with opacification of the right mastoid air cells and right middle ear. Impression included expected changes related to recent autologous right hemispheric cranioplasty, postoperative fluid underlying the craniotomy, and soft tissue swelling overlying the right convexity. Follow-up imaging was recommended to document resolution of the right convexity fluid. The report was electronically signed by James R. Mason, DO on July 6, 2023, at 10:28.",

      "description_full": "The patient underwent a right cranioplasty frontotemporoparietal with replacement of his own bone flap on June 22, 2023, following a large right MCA territory infarct sustained in February 2023. The infarct had led to cerebral edema, necessitating a right decompressive hemicraniectomy with removal of the bone flap on February 27, 2023. The patient had a complicated and protracted recovery postoperatively, as documented in prior hospital records. By June 2023, he had recovered sufficiently for replacement of the cranial flap. The surgery was performed without complications, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Postoperative imaging on June 23, 2023, revealed postsurgical changes of the right frontoparietal bone flap reconstruction, a large region of extra-axial pneumocephalus, and a small amount of blood products along the right frontoparietal convexity. Pneumocephalus tracked into the area of encephalomalacia within the right frontal lobe and into the frontal horns and right temporal horn of the lateral ventricles. No significant midline shift was observed. Subsequent imaging on June 24 and June 27 showed stable findings, even after resuming anticoagulation therapy. The patient was discharged in stable condition on June 28, 2023.",

The attestation confirms that Dr. Lopez reviewed the patient's medical history, physical examination, laboratory results, and assessment, and discussed the findings and care plan with the resident physician. The patient was evaluated for follow-up on multiple diagnoses, including pressure injury of the foot (unstageable), urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, left hemiparesis as a late effect of cerebral infarction, influenza, pneumococcal vaccine administration, and hypokalemia. The patient was noted to have no new complaints or concerns and received contact information for referrals to physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. The patient reported not requiring medication refills at this time. During the visit, the patient experienced an episode of vomiting, attributed to discomfort from being in the clinic and wanting to leave. The patient appeared slightly improved compared to the previous visit, with increased activity and responsiveness. Vital signs included blood pressure of 101/66 (right arm, sitting position, small adult cuff), pulse of 52, temperature of 36.4°C (temporal), and oxygen saturation of 93%. The review of systems was largely negative except for neurological findings of focal weakness and generalized weakness. The patient requires specific medical supplies, including a condom catheter, catheter bags, foam pads for seating and ulcer prevention, and diapers (3xL). The patient also requires follow-up with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy, which had not been previously arranged.

Tenderness was noted bilaterally at the medial and lateral knee joint lines, worse on the right, with slightly decreased active range of motion in the right knee. No new imaging was deemed necessary at this time. The plan included continuation of home physical therapy and referral for home health physical therapy. Medications prescribed included Norco 5-325mg Q6H PRN and oxycodone 10mg BID PRN for pain management, with compliance to AB 474 noted. Robaxin was also continued for pain relief. Trigger point injections under ultrasound guidance with steroid were discussed, and the patient agreed to proceed with the procedure. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained, including potential complications such as damage to surrounding structures, infection, bleeding, worsening pain, and collapsed lung. The patient was advised that left shoulder or knee injections would likely not provide significant pain relief due to the lack of significant degenerative changes on imaging. Follow-up was scheduled for around 6/5 for trigger point injections, ensuring a three-month interval between steroid injections for safety reasons.",
