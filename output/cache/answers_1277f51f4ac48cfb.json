One of the known risk factors following a stroke like Mr. Ward had is swelling of the brain which will result in further brain damage if not recognized and promptly treated. While on the Hospital floor, Mr. Ward declined in verbal, cognitive and motor function which multiple providers noted, but failed to take appropriate action. After Mr. Ward started to decline, he had an MRI of his brain. The MRI showed a recent and evolving brain bleed which would explain Mr. Ward's decline and required immediate attention. Still, the Hospital did nothing. More than 30 hours after Mr. Ward's MRI exam, he had a CT Scan of his head, confirming a brain bleed and compression of his brainstem as a result of brain swelling. As a result of Defendants' delays, Mr. Ward suffered severe brain damage. Mr. Ward now requires around-the-clock care as a result of Defendants' lack of proper care.\nParties, Jurisdiction and Venue\n2.\nPlaintiffs Frank Ward and Rachael Ward reside in Sparks, Nevada.

After Mr. Ward started to decline, he had an MRI of his brain. The MRI showed a recent and evolving brain bleed which would explain Mr. Ward's decline and required immediate attention. Still, the Hospital did nothing. More than 30 hours after Mr. Ward's MRI exam, he had a CT Scan of his head, confirming a brain bleed and compression of his brainstem as a result of brain swelling. As a result of Defendants' delays, Mr. Ward suffered severe brain damage.

Agree with referral for home health PT\nDiagnostic workup: No new imaging needed at this time\nMedications:\n-At this time, it appears appropriate for the patient's PCP to continue prescribing Norco 5-325mg Q6H PRN and oxycodone 10mg BID PRN as long as there is compliance with AB 474. These medications help improve the patient's pain and ability to perform ADLs and progress with physical therapy. The patient is at low risk for narcotic abuse. -Okay to continue Robaxin which is helping with the patient's pain\nInterventions:\n- Trigger point injections under ultrasound guidance with steroid given partial relief with trigger point injections with local anesthetic. The risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure were discussed and the patient wishes to proceed with the procedure. Risks include but are not limited to damage to surrounding structures, infection, bleeding, worsening of pain which can be permanent, and collapsed lung. Benefits include pain relief and improved function. Alternatives include not doing the procedure.\n-I have discussed that at this time, I do not think that a left shoulder injection or knee injections would significantly improve the patient's pain given the lack of significant degenerative changes on his x-ray.\nFollow-up: Next available for trigger point injections with steroid\nOrders Placed This Encounter\n· Referral to Pain Clinic\n. amoxicillin-clavulanate (AUGMENTIN) 875-125 MG Tab\n· predniSONE (DELTASONE) 20 MG Tab\n· minoxidil (LONITEN) 2.5 MG Tab\n· ALPRAZolam (XANAX) 0.5 MG Tab\nSharlene Su, MD Interventional Pain and Spine Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\nPrinted on 10/29/24 12:24 PM\nRenown Physiatry 350\nPage 349\nRENOWN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER 1155 Mill Street Reno NV 89502-1576\nWard, Frank Delino Jr. MRN: 3216290, DOB: 11/12/1969, Legal Sex: M Visit date: 2/21/2024\nMedications (continued)\nPhysician Progress Notes (continued)\nRenown Medical Group\nThe above note documents my personal evaluation of this patient.

While on the Hospital floor, Mr. Ward declined in verbal, cognitive and motor function which multiple providers noted, but failed to take appropriate action. After Mr. Ward started to decline, he had an MRI of his brain. The MRI showed a recent and evolving brain bleed which would explain Mr. Ward's decline and required immediate attention. Still, the Hospital did nothing. More than 30 hours after Mr. Ward's MRI exam, he had a CT Scan of his head, confirming a brain bleed and compression of his brainstem as a result of brain swelling. As a result of Defendants' delays, Mr. Ward suffered severe brain damage. Mr. Ward now requires around-the-clock care as a result of Defendants' lack of proper care.\nParties, Jurisdiction and Venue\n2.\nPlaintiffs Frank Ward and Rachael Ward reside in Sparks, Nevada.

Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening. Follow-up is needed with Dr. Suh (Neurosurgery) for timing craniectomy bone flap replacement.\nThis is a brief account of the patient's stay in the ICU. Please refer to EMR for complete record.\n60.\nMr. Ward was discharged to Brooks Rehabilitation on May 3, 2023 where he remained through July 6, 2023.\n61.\nFollowing discharge from Brooks Rehabilitation, Mr. Ward required and continues to require around-the-clock care. Mrs. Ward had to quit her job and move herself and her husband to Sparks, Nevada, where she has family to help her care for her husband.\n14\nRECEIVED FOR FILING, STATE COURT CLERK CHATHAM CO.

          "chunk_full": "overlying tissue and the dura. There was an area posteriorly where we could see clear fluid through a small dural defect. We worked with the sharp reflection of the skin flap off of the dura as well as using Metzenbaum scissors. Once we had elevated the skin flap and had circumferentially exposed the bone edges from the skull we irrigated copiously with antibiotic saline. We then placed 2 dural tack-up sutures. We placed a large piece of DuraGen. We had placed bone flap in antibiotic laden saline. We placed the bone flap and it fit nicely. There was no undue pressure on the underlying brain. We then placed our cranial plates using 2 burr hole covers and 1 sq plate. These were attached with the 4-0 screws. We then anchored the bone flap back to the patient's skull using 4-0 titanium screws. We had placed the dural tack-up holes in the bone flap. Tack-up sutures were then secured. We irrigated copiously with antibiotic laden saline. The skull flap was at least 16 x 20 cm.\nA JP drain was placed and brought out through separate stab incision. The wound was then closed in an interrupted fashion with sutures and then the skin with staples. A sterile dressing was applied.\nThe surgical assistant was present throughout the case and assisted with all aspects of the case including but not limited to the exposure, retraction, microdissection, hemostasis, irrigation and the closure during the entire case.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure without obvious complication.

        "alleged": "RATING: 8. Most significant injuries where patient survives but has fatal prognosis or requires lifelong care: severe brain damage; CP; quadriplegia; major burns; failure to diagnose cancer with evidence of spread and a poor prognosis, etc. OR a neurological injury resulting in being bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention.\n\nEXPLANATION: The plaintiff alleges severe neurological injury resulting from a massive right MCA stroke, leading to left-sided hemiparesis and significant functional impairments. The patient requires an electric wheelchair, Hoyer lift for transfers, and exhibits flaccid motor response and no movement in the left upper and lower extremities, indicating severe disability. These findings align with a neurological injury necessitating constant care and assistance. [Sources: Document 1, Document 2, Document 3, Document 4, Document 5]",

Most significant injuries where patient survives but has fatal prognosis or requires lifelong care: severe brain damage; CP; quadriplegia; major burns; failure to diagnose cancer with evidence of spread and a poor prognosis, etc. OR a neurological injury resulting in being bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention.**\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The patient suffered a massive right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, which necessitated a right-sided craniectomy and later replacement of the bone flap. The stroke resulted in left-sided hemiparesis (partial paralysis) and significant neurological deficits, including no motor function in the left upper and lower extremities (LUE and LLE) and absent left hand grip strength. The patient requires a Hoyer lift for transfers and is dependent on an electric wheelchair for mobility, indicating severe physical and neurological impairments. Additionally, the patient has other injuries, including a slightly displaced osteochondral fragment at the lateral femoral condyle, mild osteoarthritis in both knees, and mild AC joint osteoarthritis with subluxation of the left humeral head. These findings collectively indicate a severe, permanent injury requiring lifelong care and assistance with activities of daily living.

          "chunk_full": "gnificant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023.

          "chunk_full": "gnificant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening.

He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event.

Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023.

The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS.

          "chunk_full": "gnificant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023.

He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening. Follow-up is needed with Dr. Suh (Neurosurgery) for timing craniectomy bone flap replacement.\nThis is a brief account of the patient's stay in the ICU. Please refer to EMR for complete record.\n60.\nMr. Ward was discharged to Brooks Rehabilitation on May 3, 2023 where he remained through July 6, 2023.\n61.\nFollowing discharge from Brooks Rehabilitation, Mr. Ward required and continues to require around-the-clock care.

When the neurosurgeon asked for RN and asked why patient had not been down to CT yet, RN informed surgeon that she was coming to ask where transport was because RN could not leave the floor due to having 6 other patients with varying acuity. A call was made down to transport about the severity of this and the urgency needed for patient. Charge nurse stepped in and transported patient down to CT with HUC. Patient then went to PACU and did not return to the floor. RN called and gave report to PACU nurse.\n56.\nAt 1:32p.m. February 27, 2023, Dr. Suh began performing an emergent decompressive hemicraniectomy surgery.\n57.\nSurgery ended at 4:08p.m. and Mr. Ward was brought to the ICU.\n58.\nAt 7:03p.m., Dr. Osman Perez, critical care physician in the ICU, documented the following in his interval history for Mr. Ward:\n. Repeat head CT on 02/24 showed a stable exam with similar 5 mm shift.\n. On 02/26 around 01:00 the patient was taken for MRI BATT which had been ordered as part of his initial stroke workup but had not been done due to patient clinical status. MRI BATT showed evolving large right MCA territory subacute infarction with regions of hemosiderin deposition with 1.2 cm of leftward midline shift. This was significantly increased leftward shift when compared to CT scan from 02/24. This was noted in the primary team's note, however no documentation about a change in mental status or plan for adjustment of treatment based on those findings.\n. On 02/27 patient was reportedly still more somnolent so a CT head was ordered which showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles. It also showed conclusion of right MCA territory infarction with no lobar hemorrhage.\n. Based on this imaging, neurosurgery decided to take the patient for right hemicraniectomy with placement of an ICP monitor. The plan is for the patient to remain intubated following the procedure. He also received a PICC line for 3% NS\n59.\nFollowing the hemicraniectomy surgery, Mr. Ward remained at Savannah Memorial until May 3, 2023, during which time, he experienced numerous complications, many of which were due to Hospital neglect. For instance, there were two occasions where Mr. Ward bled profusely\n13\nRECEIVED FOR FILING, STATE COURT CLERK CHATHAM CO.

His discharge summary described the following hospital course, including the second profuse bleeding event on April 12, 2023 where Mr. Ward was found covered in blood and which led to him suffering cardiac arrest.\n53-year-old male with past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented initially to an outside hospital with acute onset of left-sided weakness on 2/17/2023. OSH imaging revealed right M1 occlusion and patient received TNK at OSH. He was transferred to our facility for LVO thrombectomy with Interventional Radiology which was completed shortly after admission to our facility on 2/17/2023. Repeat imaging revealed significant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging."

Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging.

This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening.

He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging.

Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023.

He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening.

He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging.

This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening. Follow-up is needed with Dr. Suh (Neurosurgery) for timing craniectomy bone flap replacement.\nThis is a brief account of the patient's stay in the ICU.

Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening. Follow-up is needed with Dr. Suh (Neurosurgery) for timing craniectomy bone flap replacement.\nThis is a brief account of the patient's stay in the ICU. Please refer to EMR for complete record.\n60.\nMr. Ward was discharged to Brooks Rehabilitation on May 3, 2023 where he remained through July 6, 2023.\n61.\nFollowing discharge from Brooks Rehabilitation, Mr. Ward required and continues to require around-the-clock care. Mrs. Ward had to quit her job and move herself and her husband to Sparks, Nevada, where she has family to help her care for her husband.\n14\nRECEIVED FOR FILING, STATE COURT CLERK CHATHAM CO.

No verbal response this morning\" and he was unable to perform a review of systems due to \"mental status change.\" He noted that the brain MRI from 2/26/23 suggested increasing shift up to 1.2 cm. In his plan, he noted the following: \"awaiting repeat CT head without contrast this morning. If shift is still increased past 1.0 cm, likely needs to transfer back to monitored unit and resume hypertonic saline. Will review CT once images available and base final recommendations of this newest scan.\"\n51.\nPA Allen' note at 9:36 a.m."

          "chunk_full": "gnificant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023.

          "chunk_full": "gnificant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening. Follow-up is needed with Dr. Suh (Neurosurgery) for timing craniectomy bone flap replacement.\nThis is a brief account of the patient's stay in the ICU.

He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging.

Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023.

He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening.

The neurological team at Savannah Memorial Hospital performed a thrombectomy, and Mr. Ward was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Mr. Ward's condition stabilized and his motor, cognitive and verbal function improved. Mr. Ward was discharged from the ICU to the main floor of the Hospital, where he was supposed to be\n1\n)\nRECEIVED FOR FILING, STATE COURT CLERK CHATHAM CO. GA, 12/20/2024 3:24 PM\n- Clerk of Court\n7\n3\nfrequently monitored for signs of neurological decline and treated appropriately. One of the known risk factors following a stroke like Mr. Ward had is swelling of the brain which will result in further brain damage if not recognized and promptly treated. While on the Hospital floor, Mr. Ward declined in verbal, cognitive and motor function which multiple providers noted, but failed to take appropriate action. After Mr. Ward started to decline, he had an MRI of his brain. The MRI showed a recent and evolving brain bleed which would explain Mr. Ward's decline and required immediate attention. Still, the Hospital did nothing. More than 30 hours after Mr. Ward's MRI exam, he had a CT Scan of his head, confirming a brain bleed and compression of his brainstem as a result of brain swelling. As a result of Defendants' delays, Mr. Ward suffered severe brain damage. Mr. Ward now requires around-the-clock care as a result of Defendants' lack of proper care.\nParties, Jurisdiction and Venue\n2.\nPlaintiffs Frank Ward and Rachael Ward reside in Sparks, Nevada. Plaintiffs subject themselves to the jurisdiction and venue of this Court.\n3."

Repeat head CT on 02/24 showed a stable exam with similar 5 mm shift.\n. On 02/26 around 01:00 the patient was taken for MRI BATT which had been ordered as part of his initial stroke workup but had not been done due to patient clinical status. MRI BATT showed evolving large right MCA territory subacute infarction with regions of hemosiderin deposition with 1.2 cm of leftward midline shift. This was significantly increased leftward shift when compared to CT scan from 02/24. This was noted in the primary team's note, however no documentation about a change in mental status or plan for adjustment of treatment based on those findings.\n. On 02/27 patient was reportedly still more somnolent so a CT head was ordered which showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles. It also showed conclusion of right MCA territory infarction with no lobar hemorrhage.\n. Based on this imaging, neurosurgery decided to take the patient for right hemicraniectomy with placement of an ICP monitor. The plan is for the patient to remain intubated following the procedure. He also received a PICC line for 3% NS\n59.\nFollowing the hemicraniectomy surgery, Mr. Ward remained at Savannah Memorial until May 3, 2023, during which time, he experienced numerous complications, many of which were due to Hospital neglect.

He failed a trial of extubation and underwent tracheostomy 3/10/23. Pulmonary will follow for trach management.\nHis ICU course was complicated by pseudomonal and staphylococcal infections (both methicillin sensitive and resistant isolates). He has been on antibiotics and is currently on them for pneumonia. He has recently been febrile. He developed acute renal failure and was initiated on dialysis 3/27. Nephrology is following. On 4/11/2023 the patient had bleeding initially thought to be around the trach site. Ultimately was found that it was coming from the site of his IVC filter placement and a suture was placed and was transfused for a hgb of 5.6. Bleeding has now stabilized. He was briefly in step-down but was transition back to the ICU Patient was re-initiated on sedation and mechanical ventilation as he became lethargic during all this. Per ICU notes patient became bradycardic but rebounded without intervention. At approximately 8am this morning the patient had a long asystole arrest. Responded to atropine. He again had an asystole arrest at 10am requiring brief CPR. He was again given atropine. His sedation has been weaned as able. He is currently normal sinus rhythm on telemetry. He has had episodes of junctional bradycardia as well as brief Mobitz type 2 today. Cardiology has been asked to consult because of this.\nProblem List\n.

He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening.

Repeat head CT on 02/24 showed a stable exam with similar 5 mm shift.\n. On 02/26 around 01:00 the patient was taken for MRI BATT which had been ordered as part of his initial stroke workup but had not been done due to patient clinical status. MRI BATT showed evolving large right MCA territory subacute infarction with regions of hemosiderin deposition with 1.2 cm of leftward midline shift. This was significantly increased leftward shift when compared to CT scan from 02/24. This was noted in the primary team's note, however no documentation about a change in mental status or plan for adjustment of treatment based on those findings.\n. On 02/27 patient was reportedly still more somnolent so a CT head was ordered which showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles. It also showed conclusion of right MCA territory infarction with no lobar hemorrhage.\n. Based on this imaging, neurosurgery decided to take the patient for right hemicraniectomy with placement of an ICP monitor. The plan is for the patient to remain intubated following the procedure. He also received a PICC line for 3% NS\n59.\nFollowing the hemicraniectomy surgery, Mr. Ward remained at Savannah Memorial until May 3, 2023, during which time, he experienced numerous complications, many of which were due to Hospital neglect.

He was transferred to our facility for LVO thrombectomy with Interventional Radiology which was completed shortly after admission to our facility on 2/17/2023. Repeat imaging revealed significant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery.

His discharge summary described the following hospital course, including the second profuse bleeding event on April 12, 2023 where Mr. Ward was found covered in blood and which led to him suffering cardiac arrest.\n53-year-old male with past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented initially to an outside hospital with acute onset of left-sided weakness on 2/17/2023. OSH imaging revealed right M1 occlusion and patient received TNK at OSH. He was transferred to our facility for LVO thrombectomy with Interventional Radiology which was completed shortly after admission to our facility on 2/17/2023. Repeat imaging revealed significant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging."

Use of Biological Samples. During your care at the facility, biological samples (such as blood and tissue samples) might be collected from you for purposes of your care. Sometimes, after your visit there might be excess or leftover biological samples no longer needed for your care. These samples are usually discarded. However, sometimes these samples might be used for research within our hospitals and occasionally made available to researchers at external groups such as universities, private companies, advocacy groups, and government agencies. The research can help answer questions about the causes of diseases, how to prevent them, or even how to treat them. Please note that for this kind of research, (i) there might be no practical way to inform you about the details or results of the research (even if it involves genetic research), (ii) generally, no results on tests performed on your samples during the research can be returned to you or entered into your health record, (iii) it is not likely that you will directly benefit from the research, and (iv) there are no plans to compensate or recognize you for use of your samples or any discoveries made during the research. When these samples are used in this manner, your privacy is safeguarded consistent with applicable federal and state privacy laws.\n5.

As part of the services provided, you may be treated with a medication that has not received FDA approval. You may also receive a medication that has been prepared or repackaged by an outsourcing facility or compounding pharmacy. Certain medications for which there are no alternatives or which your physician recommends may be necessary for potentially life-saving treatment.\n6. Consent to Product Patient Assistance Programs Limited Power of Attorney (\"LPOA\"). The Provider may be able to get free replacement or reimbursement for the cost of your drugs or medical products from the companies that make them through a patient assistance program sponsored by the companies that make your drugs or medical products and through charity foundations."

He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event.

This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval.

Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023.

A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening. Follow-up is needed with Dr. Suh (Neurosurgery) for timing craniectomy bone flap replacement.\nThis is a brief account of the patient's stay in the ICU. Please refer to EMR for complete record.\n60.\nMr. Ward was discharged to Brooks Rehabilitation on May 3, 2023 where he remained through July 6, 2023.\n61.\nFollowing discharge from Brooks Rehabilitation, Mr. Ward required and continues to require around-the-clock care.

          "chunk_full": "gnificant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening. Follow-up is needed with Dr. Suh (Neurosurgery) for timing craniectomy bone flap replacement.\nThis is a brief account of the patient's stay in the ICU. Please refer to EMR for complete record.\n60.\nMr. Ward was discharged to Brooks Rehabilitation on May 3, 2023 where he remained through July 6, 2023.\n61.\nFollowing discharge from Brooks Rehabilitation, Mr. Ward required and continues to require around-the-clock care. Mrs. Ward had to quit her job and move herself and her husband to Sparks, Nevada, where she has family to help her care for her husband.\n14\nRECEIVED FOR FILING, STATE COURT CLERK CHATHAM CO. GA, 12/20/2024 3:24 PM\n> wiwo - Clerk of Court\n62\nAs a result of Mr. Ward's brain injury due to Defendants' delay in treatment, Mr. Ward has incurred and continues to incur medical expenses, has lost and continues to lose wages, has suffered and continues to suffer severe pain, mental anguish, fear, shock and horror of his condition, loss of use of his body, loss of enjoyment of life, severe impairment of health and vigor physically and mentally, permanent disfigurement, loss of capacity to labor, physical confinement, and other harms and losses entitling Plaintiff Mr. Ward to compensation in an amount to be determined by the enlightened consciousness of a jury.\n63.\nAs a result of Mr. Ward's brain injury due to Defendants' delay in treatment, Mrs. Ward has lost the society, companionship, and services of her husband.\nCount I: Professional Negligence (All Defendants)\n64.\nPlaintiffs incorporate the paragraphs above as if fully restated herein.\n65."

On 02/26 around 01:00 the patient was taken for MRI BATT which had been ordered as part of his initial stroke workup but had not been done due to patient clinical status. MRI BATT showed evolving large right MCA territory subacute infarction with regions of hemosiderin deposition with 1.2 cm of leftward midline shift. This was significantly increased leftward shift when compared to CT scan from 02/24. This was noted in the primary team's note, however no documentation about a change in mental status or plan for adjustment of treatment based on those findings.\n. On 02/27 patient was reportedly still more somnolent so a CT head was ordered which showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles. It also showed conclusion of right MCA territory infarction with no lobar hemorrhage.\n. Based on this imaging, neurosurgery decided to take the patient for right hemicraniectomy with placement of an ICP monitor. The plan is for the patient to remain intubated following the procedure. He also received a PICC line for 3% NS\n59.\nFollowing the hemicraniectomy surgery, Mr. Ward remained at Savannah Memorial until May 3, 2023, during which time, he experienced numerous complications, many of which were due to Hospital neglect.

Repeat CT head today due to continued somnolence.\"\n50.\nThomas Allen, PA with the neurosurgical team noted at 9:36a.m. on February 27, 2023 that Mr. Ward was \"somewhat less alert this morning verses last week\" and that he was \"resting but arouses with prompting ... No verbal response this morning\" and he was unable to perform a review of systems due to \"mental status change.\" He noted that the brain MRI from 2/26/23 suggested increasing shift up to 1.2 cm. In his plan, he noted the following: \"awaiting repeat CT head without contrast this morning. If shift is still increased past 1.0 cm, likely needs to transfer back to monitored unit and resume hypertonic saline. Will review CT once images available and base final recommendations of this newest scan.\"\n51.\nPA Allen' note at 9:36 a.m. on February 27, 2023 is the earliest documented record that the Hospital's neurological team was aware of Mr. Ward's \"evolving\" stroke. This time is 31 hours after the Hospital's radiologist read Mr. Ward's MRI report which showed an \"evolving\" stroke and 49.5 hours after Hospital nurses observed and noted Mr. Ward's cognitive decline.\n11\nRECEIVED FOR FILING, STATE COURT CLERK CHATHAM CO. GA, 12/20/2024 3:24 PM\n1 1\nVINOS - Clerk of Court\n52.\nAt 11:49a.m. on February 27, 2023, Mr. Ward had a CT scan of his head. It showed \"1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles. Conclusion right middle cerebral artery territory infarction with no lobar hemorrhage\".\n53.\nDr. Suh's note from the morning of February 27, 2023 noted that \"patient sleepier the morning. Will open eyes and follow commands. Plan for CT Head. Possible surgery if persistent shift on CT Head with change in neurological status. Discussed with wife. Have reviewed with Operating Room.\"\n54.\nFollowing the CT scan, Dr. Suh noted that \"CT Head showed right to left shift approximately 1.3 cm by my measurement which represents increase when compared to prior CT Head. Have recommended right hemicraniectomy with placement of Intracranial Pressure monitor. Have requested PIC line for 3% Normal Saline. Will keep intubated post operative. Have informed ICU need for bed.\"\n55.\nAt 1:15p.m. on February 27, 2023, Nurse Brittany Roy entered the following note:\n12\nRECEIVED FOR FILING, STATE COURT CLERK CHATHAM CO. GA, 12/20/2024 3:24 PM\nwind - Clerk of Court\nRN received report on how patient did overnight and was told patient was no longer speaking or opening eyes and the patients wife had requested CT to be done during the night and nightshift RN was told that AM team would be informed and assess if it would be needed due tot he patient just having a CT. After report day shift nurse looked at patient list and plans for the day. RN noticed patient had CT scheduled so RN went in to give patient all the morning medication and do head to toe assessment. Patient was noticeable a lot worse in condition from previous day (in regards to his responsiveness) and could not open his eyes despite trying. He was able to respond giving RN a thumbs up but RN and wife had to stimulate him multiple times throughout RN asking questions. RN saw Dr. Thoombs in nursing station and informed him immediatly of the change. He changed the CT to STAT in the system RN informed wife and said transport would be there soon. RN checked on other patients. When the neurosurgeon asked for RN and asked why patient had not been down to CT yet, RN informed surgeon that she was coming to ask where transport was because RN could not leave the floor due to having 6 other patients with varying acuity. A call was made down to transport about the severity of this and the urgency needed for patient. Charge nurse stepped in and transported patient down to CT with HUC. Patient then went to PACU and did not return to the floor. RN called and gave report to PACU nurse.\n56.\nAt 1:32p.m. February 27, 2023, Dr. Suh began performing an emergent decompressive hemicraniectomy surgery.\n57.\nSurgery ended at 4:08p.m. and Mr. Ward was brought to the ICU.\n58."

The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening. Follow-up is needed with Dr. Suh (Neurosurgery) for timing craniectomy bone flap replacement.\nThis is a brief account of the patient's stay in the ICU. Please refer to EMR for complete record.\n60.\nMr. Ward was discharged to Brooks Rehabilitation on May 3, 2023 where he remained through July 6, 2023.\n61.\nFollowing discharge from Brooks Rehabilitation, Mr. Ward required and continues to require around-the-clock care. Mrs. Ward had to quit her job and move herself and her husband to Sparks, Nevada, where she has family to help her care for her husband.\n14\nRECEIVED FOR FILING, STATE COURT CLERK CHATHAM CO. GA, 12/20/2024 3:24 PM\n> wiwo - Clerk of Court\n62\nAs a result of Mr. Ward's brain injury due to Defendants' delay in treatment, Mr. Ward has incurred and continues to incur medical expenses, has lost and continues to lose wages, has suffered and continues to suffer severe pain, mental anguish, fear, shock and horror of his condition, loss of use of his body, loss of enjoyment of life, severe impairment of health and vigor physically and mentally, permanent disfigurement, loss of capacity to labor, physical confinement, and other harms and losses entitling Plaintiff Mr. Ward to compensation in an amount to be determined by the enlightened consciousness of a jury.\n63.\nAs a result of Mr. Ward's brain injury due to Defendants' delay in treatment, Mrs. Ward has lost the society, companionship, and services of her husband.\nCount I: Professional Negligence (All Defendants)\n64.\nPlaintiffs incorporate the paragraphs above as if fully restated herein.\n65."

Repeat head CT on 02/24 showed a stable exam with similar 5 mm shift.\n. On 02/26 around 01:00 the patient was taken for MRI BATT which had been ordered as part of his initial stroke workup but had not been done due to patient clinical status. MRI BATT showed evolving large right MCA territory subacute infarction with regions of hemosiderin deposition with 1.2 cm of leftward midline shift. This was significantly increased leftward shift when compared to CT scan from 02/24. This was noted in the primary team's note, however no documentation about a change in mental status or plan for adjustment of treatment based on those findings.\n. On 02/27 patient was reportedly still more somnolent so a CT head was ordered which showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles. It also showed conclusion of right MCA territory infarction with no lobar hemorrhage.\n. Based on this imaging, neurosurgery decided to take the patient for right hemicraniectomy with placement of an ICP monitor. The plan is for the patient to remain intubated following the procedure. He also received a PICC line for 3% NS\n59.\nFollowing the hemicraniectomy surgery, Mr. Ward remained at Savannah Memorial until May 3, 2023, during which time, he experienced numerous complications, many of which were due to Hospital neglect.

He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval. On 4/12/2023 the patient was found covered in blood which was noted to come from this site. A stitch was placed in the site and the bleeding did resolve however the patient became hemodynamically unstable secondary to acute blood loss. Hours after the bleeding had resolved and hemoglobin had remained stable after receiving MTP the patient did experience a short witnessed cardiac arrest with ROSC acheived quickly with one round of ACLS. There have not been any further episodes of bleeding since this event.\nThe remainder of the patient's hospitalization included vent weaning and ultimately tracheostomy decannulation on 5/2/2023. Patient is now tolerating oral diet by mouth but does still have PEG tube in place if needed. He is stable for discharge from acute hospitalization to rehab facility for further strengthening.

When the neurosurgeon asked for RN and asked why patient had not been down to CT yet, RN informed surgeon that she was coming to ask where transport was because RN could not leave the floor due to having 6 other patients with varying acuity. A call was made down to transport about the severity of this and the urgency needed for patient. Charge nurse stepped in and transported patient down to CT with HUC. Patient then went to PACU and did not return to the floor. RN called and gave report to PACU nurse.\n56.\nAt 1:32p.m. February 27, 2023, Dr. Suh began performing an emergent decompressive hemicraniectomy surgery.\n57.\nSurgery ended at 4:08p.m. and Mr. Ward was brought to the ICU.\n58.\nAt 7:03p.m., Dr. Osman Perez, critical care physician in the ICU, documented the following in his interval history for Mr. Ward:\n. Repeat head CT on 02/24 showed a stable exam with similar 5 mm shift.\n. On 02/26 around 01:00 the patient was taken for MRI BATT which had been ordered as part of his initial stroke workup but had not been done due to patient clinical status. MRI BATT showed evolving large right MCA territory subacute infarction with regions of hemosiderin deposition with 1.2 cm of leftward midline shift. This was significantly increased leftward shift when compared to CT scan from 02/24. This was noted in the primary team's note, however no documentation about a change in mental status or plan for adjustment of treatment based on those findings.\n. On 02/27 patient was reportedly still more somnolent so a CT head was ordered which showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles. It also showed conclusion of right MCA territory infarction with no lobar hemorrhage.\n. Based on this imaging, neurosurgery decided to take the patient for right hemicraniectomy with placement of an ICP monitor. The plan is for the patient to remain intubated following the procedure. He also received a PICC line for 3% NS\n59.\nFollowing the hemicraniectomy surgery, Mr. Ward remained at Savannah Memorial until May 3, 2023, during which time, he experienced numerous complications, many of which were due to Hospital neglect. For instance, there were two occasions where Mr. Ward bled profusely\n13\nRECEIVED FOR FILING, STATE COURT CLERK CHATHAM CO. GA, 12/20/2024 3:24 PM\nVINOS\n- Clerk of Court\nand most nearly bled out before receiving any medical attention. On the second occasion, Mr. Ward coded twice due to blood loss. His discharge summary described the following hospital course, including the second profuse bleeding event on April 12, 2023 where Mr. Ward was found covered in blood and which led to him suffering cardiac arrest.\n53-year-old male with past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented initially to an outside hospital with acute onset of left-sided weakness on 2/17/2023. OSH imaging revealed right M1 occlusion and patient received TNK at OSH. He was transferred to our facility for LVO thrombectomy with Interventional Radiology which was completed shortly after admission to our facility on 2/17/2023. Repeat imaging revealed significant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging."

The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging."

          "chunk_full": "T to STAT in the system RN informed wife and said transport would be there soon. RN checked on other patients. When the neurosurgeon asked for RN and asked why patient had not been down to CT yet, RN informed surgeon that she was coming to ask where transport was because RN could not leave the floor due to having 6 other patients with varying acuity. A call was made down to transport about the severity of this and the urgency needed for patient. Charge nurse stepped in and transported patient down to CT with HUC. Patient then went to PACU and did not return to the floor. RN called and gave report to PACU nurse.\n56.\nAt 1:32p.m. February 27, 2023, Dr. Suh began performing an emergent decompressive hemicraniectomy surgery.\n57.\nSurgery ended at 4:08p.m. and Mr. Ward was brought to the ICU.\n58.\nAt 7:03p.m., Dr. Osman Perez, critical care physician in the ICU, documented the following in his interval history for Mr. Ward:\n. Repeat head CT on 02/24 showed a stable exam with similar 5 mm shift.\n. On 02/26 around 01:00 the patient was taken for MRI BATT which had been ordered as part of his initial stroke workup but had not been done due to patient clinical status. MRI BATT showed evolving large right MCA territory subacute infarction with regions of hemosiderin deposition with 1.2 cm of leftward midline shift. This was significantly increased leftward shift when compared to CT scan from 02/24. This was noted in the primary team's note, however no documentation about a change in mental status or plan for adjustment of treatment based on those findings.\n. On 02/27 patient was reportedly still more somnolent so a CT head was ordered which showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles. It also showed conclusion of right MCA territory infarction with no lobar hemorrhage.\n. Based on this imaging, neurosurgery decided to take the patient for right hemicraniectomy with placement of an ICP monitor. The plan is for the patient to remain intubated following the procedure. He also received a PICC line for 3% NS\n59.\nFollowing the hemicraniectomy surgery, Mr. Ward remained at Savannah Memorial until May 3, 2023, during which time, he experienced numerous complications, many of which were due to Hospital neglect. For instance, there were two occasions where Mr. Ward bled profusely\n13\nRECEIVED FOR FILING, STATE COURT CLERK CHATHAM CO. GA, 12/20/2024 3:24 PM\nVINOS\n- Clerk of Court\nand most nearly bled out before receiving any medical attention. On the second occasion, Mr. Ward coded twice due to blood loss. His discharge summary described the following hospital course, including the second profuse bleeding event on April 12, 2023 where Mr. Ward was found covered in blood and which led to him suffering cardiac arrest.\n53-year-old male with past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented initially to an outside hospital with acute onset of left-sided weakness on 2/17/2023. OSH imaging revealed right M1 occlusion and patient received TNK at OSH. He was transferred to our facility for LVO thrombectomy with Interventional Radiology which was completed shortly after admission to our facility on 2/17/2023. Repeat imaging revealed significant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging."

When the neurosurgeon asked for RN and asked why patient had not been down to CT yet, RN informed surgeon that she was coming to ask where transport was because RN could not leave the floor due to having 6 other patients with varying acuity. A call was made down to transport about the severity of this and the urgency needed for patient. Charge nurse stepped in and transported patient down to CT with HUC. Patient then went to PACU and did not return to the floor. RN called and gave report to PACU nurse.\n56.\nAt 1:32p.m. February 27, 2023, Dr. Suh began performing an emergent decompressive hemicraniectomy surgery.\n57.\nSurgery ended at 4:08p.m. and Mr. Ward was brought to the ICU.\n58.\nAt 7:03p.m., Dr. Osman Perez, critical care physician in the ICU, documented the following in his interval history for Mr. Ward:\n. Repeat head CT on 02/24 showed a stable exam with similar 5 mm shift.\n. On 02/26 around 01:00 the patient was taken for MRI BATT which had been ordered as part of his initial stroke workup but had not been done due to patient clinical status. MRI BATT showed evolving large right MCA territory subacute infarction with regions of hemosiderin deposition with 1.2 cm of leftward midline shift. This was significantly increased leftward shift when compared to CT scan from 02/24. This was noted in the primary team's note, however no documentation about a change in mental status or plan for adjustment of treatment based on those findings.\n. On 02/27 patient was reportedly still more somnolent so a CT head was ordered which showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles. It also showed conclusion of right MCA territory infarction with no lobar hemorrhage.\n. Based on this imaging, neurosurgery decided to take the patient for right hemicraniectomy with placement of an ICP monitor. The plan is for the patient to remain intubated following the procedure. He also received a PICC line for 3% NS\n59.\nFollowing the hemicraniectomy surgery, Mr. Ward remained at Savannah Memorial until May 3, 2023, during which time, he experienced numerous complications, many of which were due to Hospital neglect. For instance, there were two occasions where Mr. Ward bled profusely\n13\nRECEIVED FOR FILING, STATE COURT CLERK CHATHAM CO. GA, 12/20/2024 3:24 PM\nVINOS\n- Clerk of Court\nand most nearly bled out before receiving any medical attention. On the second occasion, Mr. Ward coded twice due to blood loss. His discharge summary described the following hospital course, including the second profuse bleeding event on April 12, 2023 where Mr. Ward was found covered in blood and which led to him suffering cardiac arrest.\n53-year-old male with past medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented initially to an outside hospital with acute onset of left-sided weakness on 2/17/2023. OSH imaging revealed right M1 occlusion and patient received TNK at OSH. He was transferred to our facility for LVO thrombectomy with Interventional Radiology which was completed shortly after admission to our facility on 2/17/2023. Repeat imaging revealed significant edema and mass effect and neurosurgery was consulted on 2/19/2023. The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging."

Repeat head CT on 02/24 showed a stable exam with similar 5 mm shift.\n. On 02/26 around 01:00 the patient was taken for MRI BATT which had been ordered as part of his initial stroke workup but had not been done due to patient clinical status. MRI BATT showed evolving large right MCA territory subacute infarction with regions of hemosiderin deposition with 1.2 cm of leftward midline shift. This was significantly increased leftward shift when compared to CT scan from 02/24.

When the neurosurgeon asked for RN and asked why patient had not been down to CT yet, RN informed surgeon that she was coming to ask where transport was because RN could not leave the floor due to having 6 other patients with varying acuity. A call was made down to transport about the severity of this and the urgency needed for patient. Charge nurse stepped in and transported patient down to CT with HUC.

The patient remained alert during this time however on 2/27/2023 the patient became more somnolent and head CT showed 1 cm right uncal herniation with brainstem compression and 1.5 cm right to left subfalcine herniation with compression of bilateral ventricles with no evidence of hemorrhage and patient was taken that day for decompressive craniectomy with Neurosurgery. He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event. Ultimately he did require hemodialysis and received tunneled hemodialysis catheter on 3/27/2023. This catheter has since been removed and the patient's last hemodialysis was on 4/7/2023 and he now has full renal recovery.\nAnother complication during the patient's hospitalization was acute blood loss anemia secondary to significant bleeding from right IJ puncture site that was used for IVC filter retrieval.

He remained intubated until 3/6/2023 but on 3/7/2023 the patient experienced respiratory failure with left lung mucus plugging resulting in full whiteout and requiring re-intubation. Ultimately, the patient received tracheostomy on 3/10/2023 for long vent wean as well as multiple bronchoscopies needing to be performed for significant mucus plugging. Patient also received IVC filter prophylactically secondary to inability to anticoagulate with large stroke burden around 3/3/2023 which was removed on 3/14/2023.\nAround 3/24/2023 the patient's renal function declined without any inciting event.

      "main_question": "Note: When responding to the below questions, Degree of Injury (DOI) does not imply the Standard of Care or Causation. It's possible for the Standard of Care to be of high quality and the Causation to be very good, and yet the Degree of Injury could be severe, including major permanent harm or even death. Conversely, even when the Standard of Care and Causation are significantly lacking, the Degree of Injury might be minimal. This distinction highlights that the severity of an injury does not directly correlate with the quality of care or show a causal relationship. The SOC is the care, skill, and treatment recognized as pertinent by similar, reasonably prudent health care providers. It is determined in the context of all relevant circumstances and available information. SOC serves as the benchmark in assessing the appropriateness of the provider's actions, including both direct patient care and in the supervision of or formal collaboration with other providers. Conceptually, the standard of care is a continuum, ranging from that which is minimally required to that which is exceptional. Accordingly, to meet the standard, a provider's care, at the very least, must be considered acceptable; otherwise, it is negligent care. The standard in any given situation is influenced by several factors, including but not limited to statutes, regulations, clinical guidelines, research, and facility policies and procedures. Based on your thorough assessment, provide a final rating of the standard of care. 1. SELECT ONE",

      "raw_answer": "RATING: 3. Standard of Care cannot be determined due to the need for additional information.\n\nEXPLANATION: While the provided documents contain detailed clinical notes, imaging results, lab values, and medication lists, they do not provide sufficient information to evaluate the appropriateness of the defendant's actions or inactions against the standard of care. Specifically, there is no clear documentation of the clinical decision-making process, adherence to guidelines, or specific interventions that would allow for a definitive assessment. Additionally, the records do not provide enough context about the timeline of events, communication between providers, or whether any deviations from standard practice occurred. Further information, such as detailed provider notes, policies, and expert opinions, would be necessary to accurately assess the standard of care. [Sources: Documents 1-5]",

      "main_question": "Causation reflects whether a provider's actions (or inactions) caused or contributed to an injury. Causation is not dependent on whether the Standard of Care was met. For example, a patient presents with 3 days of left-sided weakness and the physician fails to diagnose cerebrovascular accident, but the onset of symptoms is further out than any emergent treatment window. Therefore, the physician has not met the SOC for missing the diagnosis of CVA, but the defendant's actions did not cause or contribute to the injury because thrombolytics and thrombectomy are no longer indicated by the time the patient presents. Thus, a timely diagnosis or any treatment rendered would not have changed the patient outcome. Based on your thorough assessment, please indicate your final opinion as to whether the defendant's care caused or contributed to the patient's injury. 1. SELECT ONE",

      "answer": 4,
      "raw_answer": "RATING: 4. The defendant's actions (or inactions) were not the primary cause but may have contributed to the injuries.\n\nEXPLANATION: The patient presented with left-sided weakness and slurred speech, consistent with acute stroke symptoms, and had an NIH stroke scale of 16. Imaging and evaluations confirmed an acute ischemic stroke due to ischemia and a hypertensive emergency. While thrombolytics (TNK) and IV nicardipine were started at an outside facility, there is no indication that delays in care at Memorial Health significantly altered the patient's outcome, as the stroke had already occurred prior to arrival. However, the defendant's actions, including delays in imaging review and intervention evaluation, may have contributed to the progression or severity of the patient's deficits. This is supported by the documented left hemiparesis and ongoing neurological impairments noted in subsequent records. [Sources: Document 1, Document 3, Document 5]",
