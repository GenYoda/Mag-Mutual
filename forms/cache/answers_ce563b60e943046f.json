One of the known risk factors following a stroke like Mr. Ward had is swelling of the brain which will result in further brain damage if not recognized and promptly treated. While on the Hospital floor, Mr. Ward declined in verbal, cognitive and motor function which multiple providers noted, but failed to take appropriate action. After Mr. Ward started to decline, he had an MRI of his brain. The MRI showed a recent and evolving brain bleed which would explain Mr. Ward's decline and required immediate attention. Still, the Hospital did nothing. More than 30 hours after Mr. Ward's MRI exam, he had a CT Scan of his head, confirming a brain bleed and compression of his brainstem as a result of brain swelling. As a result of Defendants' delays, Mr. Ward suffered severe brain damage. Mr. Ward now requires around-the-clock care as a result of Defendants' lack of proper care.\nParties, Jurisdiction and Venue\n2.\nPlaintiffs Frank Ward and Rachael Ward reside in Sparks, Nevada.

After Mr. Ward started to decline, he had an MRI of his brain. The MRI showed a recent and evolving brain bleed which would explain Mr. Ward's decline and required immediate attention. Still, the Hospital did nothing. More than 30 hours after Mr. Ward's MRI exam, he had a CT Scan of his head, confirming a brain bleed and compression of his brainstem as a result of brain swelling.

On 4/11/2023 the patient had bleeding initially thought to be around the trach site. Ultimately was found that it was coming from the site of his IVC filter placement and a suture was placed and was transfused for a hgb of 5.6. Bleeding has now stabilized. He was briefly in step-down but was transition back to the ICU Patient was re-initiated on sedation and mechanical ventilation as he became lethargic during all this. Per ICU notes patient became bradycardic but rebounded without intervention. At approximately 8am this morning the patient had a long asystole arrest. Responded to atropine. He again had an asystole arrest at 10am requiring brief CPR. He was again given atropine. His sedation has been weaned as able. He is currently normal sinus rhythm on telemetry.

Agree with referral for home health PT\nDiagnostic workup: No new imaging needed at this time\nMedications:\n-At this time, it appears appropriate for the patient's PCP to continue prescribing Norco 5-325mg Q6H PRN and oxycodone 10mg BID PRN as long as there is compliance with AB 474. These medications help improve the patient's pain and ability to perform ADLs and progress with physical therapy. The patient is at low risk for narcotic abuse. -Okay to continue Robaxin which is helping with the patient's pain\nInterventions:\n- Trigger point injections under ultrasound guidance with steroid given partial relief with trigger point injections with local anesthetic. The risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure were discussed and the patient wishes to proceed with the procedure. Risks include but are not limited to damage to surrounding structures, infection, bleeding, worsening of pain which can be permanent, and collapsed lung. Benefits include pain relief and improved function. Alternatives include not doing the procedure.\n-I have discussed that at this time, I do not think that a left shoulder injection or knee injections would significantly improve the patient's pain given the lack of significant degenerative changes on his x-ray.\nFollow-up: Next available for trigger point injections with steroid\nOrders Placed This Encounter\n· Referral to Pain Clinic\n. amoxicillin-clavulanate (AUGMENTIN) 875-125 MG Tab\n· predniSONE (DELTASONE) 20 MG Tab\n· minoxidil (LONITEN) 2.5 MG Tab\n· ALPRAZolam (XANAX) 0.5 MG Tab\nSharlene Su, MD Interventional Pain and Spine Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\nPrinted on 10/29/24 12:24 PM\nRenown Physiatry 350\nPage 349\nRENOWN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER 1155 Mill Street Reno NV 89502-1576\nWard, Frank Delino Jr. MRN: 3216290, DOB: 11/12/1969, Legal Sex: M Visit date: 2/21/2024\nMedications (continued)\nPhysician Progress Notes (continued)\nRenown Medical Group\nThe above note documents my personal evaluation of this patient.

After Mr. Ward started to decline, he had an MRI of his brain. The MRI showed a recent and evolving brain bleed which would explain Mr. Ward's decline and required immediate attention. Still, the Hospital did nothing. More than 30 hours after Mr. Ward's MRI exam, he had a CT Scan of his head, confirming a brain bleed and compression of his brainstem as a result of brain swelling.
